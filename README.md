# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
This folder contains a compilation of the major concepts in DSA which I learnt over the years. Every folder contains the problem statement and its corresponding program written in C++. It is advised to first go through the problem statement for better understanding of the programs.

For max flow algorithms, you can refer my other repository (link below), which contains the algorithms namely, Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Capacity-Scaling and Dinic's algorithm.
